You can use two types of completions in this plugin:
- words
- expressions

Words contain only letters/digits and some amount of other chars (by default only "_").
Expressions can contain all spec-chars and even any non-space chars. Expressions can be 
with spaces inside, if option "Expands to include both pair-chars" is on.

Both variants of lists (words, expr) can be used by choosing next/prev (commands 
"Use next/prev...") or by showing the full completion list (commands "Show list...").
While caret pos is not changed, you can:

- switch between types of list
- after choosing, show list
- after showing list, continue choosing

Both choosing of variants, and showing of list, begin from nearest variant
(nearest by line number), if option "Start with variant from nearest line" is on.
